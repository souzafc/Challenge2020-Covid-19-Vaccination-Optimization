# Challenge2020-Covid-19-Vaccination-Optimization

This notebook is related to a project participating in the IBM-Challenge 2020. See below for what problem this project is intended for.

Problem description:

When a vaccine for COVID-19 is ready, possibly it will not be available immediately in enough quantity to immunize everyone in every region.

Objective:

In a prescriptive analytic approach, this work proposes a linear programming model aimed to optimize a city vaccination campaign in a way to minimize the number of possible deaths in a scenario where just part of the vaccines arrives in certain regions. Here we are simulating such a scenario using SÃ£o Paulo city hall data.

Outcome:

A dashboard was created (link below) using the results generated here.
